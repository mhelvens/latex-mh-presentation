latex-mh-presentation
=====================

This is a LaTeX document-class that may be used to generate both slides and handouts
from a single source-file. Slides are ultimately created through the `beamer` class,
but this class offers different user-commands, to run some code in the background to
make everything work.

Check out `example/presentation.tex` and follow the comments for a guide to using
this document class.
